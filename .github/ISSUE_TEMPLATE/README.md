- **A `README.md` file** with these sections:

 ☐ **<Your game's title>**:
    
Memory Matching: 

    This game was created to test a players memory. To begin, start the timer, which will count down from 15. Once the timer has ended, press "Start Game" button. From there, get all the matches that you can, counting down at the top by clicking on the "Matches Left" as you find them. The game is over when you've uncovered all the matches with any extra clicks. 
    
Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.

Technologies Used:

    I use HTML for creating the content on the page, like the Memory Match heading and all of the letter inside of th cards, as well as formatting the cards as buttons and creating a start and restart button. 

    CSS was used for creating the style of the cards, the background image, and change the color, size, and font of the elements on the game. 

    Javascript was used to create the ability to clicks the start and restart buttons and have them "hide" the letters on the cards. It was also used to create the functionality to click the cards and have the letters reveal themselves, and when two cards are revealed with the same letters, the background changes to purple. 
    
Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.
    
Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

    For future enhancements, I would like to add a lose condition, where someone clicks two of the wrong cards and the Match Counter says "You Lose", as well as adding the Match Counter to countdown as the matched cards background changes. Would also like to successfully add a timer to the game at the beginning, so that it counts down before starting the game after 15 seconds.
