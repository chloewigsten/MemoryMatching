Chosen game - Memory Matching

Link to format of game screen - https://www.figma.com/file/DvMjQRSB5fZ9GYfjTkhDNI/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

1. Start creating the formatting with the grid, using HTML and CSS to style it and include all the content that I need. 
  - Create cards, create innerHTML, create reset button
2. To start, all the cards are going to have the innerHTML in them the same color as the background of the card. 

Start by creating a function that changes the color of the innerHTML when the card is clicked. 

3. Once this is set up, create a function that recognizes if the two clicked cards have the same string instead of them (use a boolean to register true or false). 

4. If boolean returns true, create function to turn the background of the cards green and lock them from being clicked again. 

5. If boolean returns false, create function to change innerHTML back to the card color so they are "hidden" again. 

6. Once all cards are green, create function to set alert that will say "You won"
